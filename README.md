Echolocation Add-ons for Visually impaired using Arduino Uno 
The main objective of the project E.A.V.I(Echolocation Add-ons
for Visually Impaired) is to assist visually impaired in locomotion
via custom built Add-ons supporting ultrasonic ranging
module(HC-SR04). It is the feedback from this module which
becomes the basis of obstacle detection. Atmega328p MCU
based board(Arduino Uno R3) is being used for eloquent
execution of project protocols.
In order to predict an obstacle's presence with higher accuracy a
servo motor is also incorporated in the system to provide an
additional Degree of Freedom to the sensor hence increasing its
field of view. As The ultrasonic ranging module detects an
obstacle within the parameters specified to the MCU the user gets
notified via beats of tones produced by a piezoelectric buzzer with
varying frequency depending upon the distance between the
sensor and the obstacle.
